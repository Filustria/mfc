    <a href="https://voxdev.org/" target="_blank"> VOXDEV - Development economics from research to practice.</a> VoxDev is a platform for economists, policymakers, practitioners, donors, 
    the private sector and others interested in development to discuss key policy issues. Expert contributors provide insightful commentary, analysis, and evidence on a wide range of 
    policy challenges in formats that we hope are accessible to a wide audience interested in development. We aim to put evidence from decades of academic research into the hands of 
    decision-makers and civil society in developing countries in a way that they can be easily accessed and actually put to use, ultimately encouraging the design and implementation 
    of more evidence-based policy. 
    <p></p>
    VoxDev, launched in June 2017, is a collaboration between the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the International Growth Centre, and the Private Enterprise Development in 
    Low Income Countries programme. The Editor-in-Chief is Tavneet Suri, supported by the Editorial Board, Robin Burgess, and Chris Woodruff, and a great group of Founding Contributors.
